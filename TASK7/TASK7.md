## ðŸš€ Views vs Functions vs Stored Procedures: Understanding Their Differences ðŸš€

In my journey at Code Wave, I've been exploring the fundamental differences between **Views**, **Functions**, and **Stored Procedures** in database management. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each concept and their ideal use cases:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Views

A view is a virtual table that displays the results of a stored query. It simplifies complex queries, encapsulates table metadata, and enhances security by restricting direct access to the underlying tables.

**Use Cases:**
- Simplify complex queries.
- Encapsulate metadata for better structure.
- Provide enhanced security by controlling access to data.

**How to Use:**  
`SELECT * FROM VIEW_NAME;`

**Limitations:**
- No procedural logic (e.g., loops or conditions).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Functions

Functions are used in databases to return values or perform tasks. There are two primary types:
- **Scalar Function:** Returns a single value.
- **Table-Valued Function:** Returns a table.

**Use Cases:**
- Reusable logic to return values.
- Simplify the usage of common tasks.

**How to Use:**  
`SELECT function_name(parameters);`

**Limitations:**
- Cannot modify the database (no `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations).

### ðŸ”¹ Stored Procedures

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that may include queries, database modifications, or procedural logic (like loops and conditions). They may return a single value, a table, or nothing at all.

**Use Cases:**
- Solve complex business problems.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Modify databases.
- Handle transactions.

**How to Use:**  
`EXEC Procedure_NAME;`

Each of these database components has its role to play in creating efficient and maintainable database systems. Understanding when and how to use them is key to optimizing your database strategy.
