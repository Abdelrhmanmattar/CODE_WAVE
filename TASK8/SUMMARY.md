## This week, I deepened my understanding of C# programming by exploring several core concepts:

### 1. **Different Ways to Print Outputs**
   - **String Interpolation**: Embedding variables directly within strings using the `$` symbol.
   - **String Concatenation**: Joining strings and variables using the `+` operator.
   - **Placeholders**: Formatting strings using `{}` to insert variables at specified positions.

### 2. **Operators**
   - Understanding the various types of **operators**: arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
   - Learning how to use operators effectively in expressions for calculations and comparisons.

### 3. **Data Types**
   - Working with common **data types** such as `int`, `float`, `string`, and `bool`.
   - Knowing the importance of choosing the right data type for variables to ensure proper memory usage and calculations.

### 4. **Order of Operations**
   - Understanding the **order of operations** in expressions to ensure accurate execution and results.

### 5. **Control Flow**
   - Using **if statements** to handle conditional logic.
   - Implementing **loops** (`for`, `while`) to repeat tasks efficiently.
